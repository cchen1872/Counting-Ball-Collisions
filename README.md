# Counting-Ball-Collisions
Created after Columbia SHAPE and AP Chemistry Final Project.

Animation was used for visualization of an interesting phenomenon in 
ideal physics.  The animation shows that if a moving mass is heading
towards a wall, and has 10^(2k) times more mass than a mass in 
between it and the wall, the object that was once at rest will collide
with the wall (pi x 10^k) times rounded downwards.

This project was inspired by 3Blue1Brown's viral video:
"The most unexpected answer to a counting puzzle"
